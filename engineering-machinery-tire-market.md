<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engineering Machinery Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The engineering machinery tire market is primarily categorized into two types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires consist of plies that are crisscrossed at angles, which enhances flexibility and provides better traction on uneven surfaces. They are generally more affordable but can wear faster. In contrast, radial tires feature plies that run perpendicular to the tread, offering superior durability, fuel efficiency, and stability at higher speeds. These tires are preferred for heavy machinery due to their longer lifespan and improved load-bearing capacity.</p></p>
