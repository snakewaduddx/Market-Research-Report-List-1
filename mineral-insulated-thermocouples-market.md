<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mineral Insulated Thermocouples Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grounded Type</li><li>Ungrounded Type</li><li>Exposed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mineral insulated thermocouple market consists of three main types: grounded, ungrounded, and exposed types. Grounded thermocouples feature a metal junction in direct contact with the sheath for rapid response, ideal for dynamic temperature changes. Ungrounded types have a thermocouple junction isolated from the sheath, providing better electrical insulation and minimal interference, suitable for stable environments. Exposed thermocouples have the sensing element directly exposed to the medium, offering fast response times but less protection against harsh conditions. Each type caters to different application needs.</p></p>
