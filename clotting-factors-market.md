<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Clotting Factors Ⅷ Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Injection</li><li>Freeze-dried Injection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Clotting Factors VIII market primarily comprises two types: injection and freeze-dried injection. Injection products deliver Factor VIII in a liquid form, providing immediate availability for hemophilia treatment. Freeze-dried injections, on the other hand, offer a stable, powdered formulation that requires reconstitution with a diluent before use. This latter type allows for easier storage and extended shelf life, making it suitable for patients who need infrequent or on-demand treatment. Both formats aim to enhance patient compliance and treatment efficacy.</p></p>
