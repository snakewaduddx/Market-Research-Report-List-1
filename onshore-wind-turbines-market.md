<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Onshore Wind Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The onshore wind turbine market consists primarily of two types: Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). HAWTs are the most commonly used, featuring blades that rotate around a horizontal axis, allowing for greater efficiency and energy capture in high-wind areas. In contrast, VAWTs have a vertical design, making them suitable for diverse wind conditions and easier maintenance. Both types contribute to renewable energy generation, with unique advantages based on location and application needs.</p></p>
